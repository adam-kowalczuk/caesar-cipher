# TODO-1: Import and print the logo from art.py when the program starts.

# TODO-4: Can you figure out a way to ask the user if they want to restart the cipher program?
# e.g. Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
# If they type 'yes' then ask them for the direction/text/shift again and call the caesar() function again?
# Hint: Try creating a while loop that continues to execute the program if the user types 'yes'.

# TODO-2: What if the user enters a shift that is greater than the number of letters in the alphabet?
# Try running the program and entering a shift number of 45.
# Add some code so that the program continues to work even if the user enters a shift number greater than 26.
# Hint: Think about how you can use the modulus (%).
