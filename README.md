# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known forms of encryption. Named after none other than Julius Caesar himself, the technique involves taking a plain-text message and replacing each character with another letter of the alphabet based on a 'shift value.' For example, inputing `hello world` with a shift value of `5` would encrypt the message as `mjqqt btwqi`. More information about the cipher can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).
